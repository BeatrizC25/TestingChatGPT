As a result, several Internet services have been created to help teachers detect copied material by showing the sources of passages that aren't original. Students need to know that any act of using another person's ideas or words without giving credit to that person is plagiarism. They must understand how serious the consequences can be. People who plagiarize may have their reputation and credibility destroyed, and they may be in violation of copyright laws.
